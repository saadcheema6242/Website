🔧 FULL-STACK APPLICATION PROMPT
Luxury Cruise Virtual Tour – Eligibility-Based Landing Page

Tech Stack Required:

Frontend: React / Next.js (preferred) OR Webflow + Custom JS

Backend: Firebase (Firestore + Authentication)

Hosting: Vercel / Firebase Hosting

UI Framework: Tailwind CSS or custom modern CSS

Form Handling: Firebase Firestore

Optional: Firebase Cloud Functions (for validation & tagging leads)

1️⃣ APPLICATION PURPOSE (VERY IMPORTANT)

Build a high-converting, luxury-styled landing page inspired by premium cruise promotions, whose only goal is:

To qualify users

To filter out unqualified leads

To register eligible couples for a 90-minute live online cruise destination presentation

In exchange for a complimentary cruise incentive (subject to eligibility & attendance)

This is NOT ecommerce, NOT booking, and NOT guaranteed free travel.

2️⃣ TARGET AUDIENCE FILTER LOGIC (BACKEND + FRONTEND)

The system must actively filter users based on:

Qualification Criteria:

Marital Status: Married / Couple only

Age: At least one attendee 45+

Household Income: $60,000+ annually

Location: USA, Canada, UK, Australia

Availability: Able to attend 90-minute online presentation within next 3 days

Logic Rules:

If user selects “No” to availability → show polite rejection message

If age < 45 → show “This program is currently limited”

If income below threshold → show ineligible message

Only qualified users can submit the form successfully

All submissions must still be saved in Firebase with a status:

qualified

unqualified

pending_review
